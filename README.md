# personalboilerplate
Minimal Boilerplate for personal use to jumpstart local Webdevelopment.
Just run "vagrant up" and start coding!

## Specs
- vagrant
- php
- sass
- jquery

### Vagrant
A minimal Box to start a local PHP-Environment with ease. Almost a clone of https://github.com/sapienza/vagrant-php-box. Just one small modification.
Remember: You need to install "Vagrant" (https://www.vagrantup.com/) and Virtualbox (https://www.virtualbox.org/) first.

### PHP
Currently using Version 5

### SASS
Currently using Codekit (which is great, but not openSource) to compile SASS-Files.
TODO: use gulp or grunt

### jquery
Get jQuery from Google, because for local development it's the easiest way to get started. The file get's loaded in modules/framework/javascript.php.
